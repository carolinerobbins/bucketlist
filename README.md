# BucketList

**BucketList is a React Native mobile application designed to help travelers easily select where to go on their next trip.**

# Exploring the Components
At a glance, there are 3 core components to BucketList: Destination Discovery, Bucket List, and Explorer Map

Below are the detailed specifications and functionality of each component.

## Destination Discovery
Destination Discovery leverages the react-native-deck-swiper package to allow users to "swipe right" on destinations they want to add to their Bucket List. Users  see an image of the destination as well as "tags" to describe the destination.  Users can also mark a destination as visited from this screen.

## Bucket List
The Bucket List displays a list of places the user has added to their bucket list, along with key flight information that can help them make a decision on the right destination for the type of trip. Users can filter by nonstop flights, best seasons to visit, and trip length.  Bucket List leverages the Amadeus APi for flight informaiton.
